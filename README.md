**Rust Cat**

This is my 3rd Project in Rust, aimed at eventually implementing a fully functional 'cat' command.

* Requirements: 
* Support the basic cat functionality such as: 
    * Display single or multiple files to standard output
    * Sending the output contents to a new file
    * Creating a new file by using the filename and > sign
    * Displaying line numbers (-n option)

* Command line options: 
    * For current development phase only*
    * (-b) - display all the lines in the file but only number non blank lines
    * (-n )- display all the lines in the file, numbered

* Usage: 
    * cat (options) (file1) (file2)
